# Employee Database Reconstruction 
This project is a part of the Module 9 challenge in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics Bootcamp. All code is authored by the creator of this repo. This README template is from the Data Science Working Group.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to utilize SQL and PostgreSQL to organize and analyze the data from given CSV files. It functions as an example of exapnding upon the usefulness of raw data by engineering a database for querying CSVs and analyzing their contents beyond the functionalities of Excel. 

### Methods Used
* Data Modeling
* Data Engineering
* Data Analysis
  
### Technologies
* SQL
* PostgreSQL

## Project Description
The data source for this project comes from Mockaroo, a data generator useful for demoing new software. This limits the data analysis to entirely hypothetical for the arbitrary company of Pewlett Hackard; although, this particular company's HR department and payroll team could benefit from the organizatinal structure this new database provides. On top of that, if the company were to face an extensive audit, it would be much easier to query the database and provide accurate reports on employees going back through the company's history.
